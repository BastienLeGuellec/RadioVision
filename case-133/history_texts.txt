A 31-year-old otherwise healthy woman presented with frequent unilateral headaches that lasted from a few hours to a few days and occurred as often as three or four times per week. Symptoms started at the time of her first pregnancy 3 years earlier and persisted without any progression in intensity or frequency. Physical examination findings were normal, and there were no neurologic deficits. Magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain (,Fig 1,,) and unenhanced computed tomographic (CT) scans of the head (,Fig 2,,) were obtained.
