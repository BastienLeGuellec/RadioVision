A 32-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with headache, vomiting, and complex partial seizures. Thirty weeks earlier, he had undergone ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement to treat hydrocephalus that had been diagnosed with cranial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Hydrocephalus was the only abnormality present. During the 30-week interval, two consecutive whole-spine MR examinations were performed 8 weeks apart at different institutions (,Figs 1,, ,2,,). Neurologic examination revealed mild decreased consciousness, papilledema, and deficits in cranial nerves III, IV, V, and VII. The patient was afebrile, and physical examination revealed no other abnormalities. The findings of laboratory tests, including extensive cerebrospinal fluid studies, were unremarkable. Cranial computed tomography (CT) was performed (,Fig 3,).
