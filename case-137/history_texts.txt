A 3-year 7-month-old boy presented to the emergency department with a 12-day history of cough and fever. Laboratory tests revealed mild anemia, monocytosis, and neutrophilia with a left shift. Both the platelet count and the C-reactive protein level were increased. A chest radiograph (,Fig 1) was obtained. This patient was discharged after 5 days of treatment with oral antibiotics. Two weeks later, recurrence of the symptoms prompted readmission. Laboratory findings were unchanged. Imaging evaluation consisted of chest radiography (,Fig 2), ultrasonography (US) (,Fig 3), and computed tomography (CT) (,Fig 4,,).
