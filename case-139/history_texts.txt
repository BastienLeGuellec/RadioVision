A 63-year-old woman presented with progressive swelling of the hard palate of 4 months duration. She had no other symptoms and no medical history of note. Physical examination revealed a 2-cm-diameter round mass on the underside of her hard palate. The mass was hard in consistency and immobile. The overlying mucosa was intact. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were performed (,Figs 1, ,2,,,).
