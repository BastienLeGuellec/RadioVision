A 31-year-old otherwise healthy man presented with early satiety and left-sided abdominal pain. His medical history was remarkable for a 20-pack-year smoking habit. Physical examination revealed a firm left-sided abdominal mass that was approximately 12 cm in diameter and slightly tender. Complete blood count and routine serum chemistry test results were within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) (,Fig 1,) and thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic computed tomography (CT) (,Figs 2,, ,3,) were performed.
