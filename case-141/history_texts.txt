A 38-year-old man was referred for follow-up magnetic resonance (MR) imaging 8 months after gamma knife radiosurgery for a predominantly intraventricular (third ventricle) arteriovenous malformation. During the past 9 years, the patient had experienced multiple episodes of intraventricular hemorrhage and resultant hydrocephalus that had necessitated multiple ventricular shunt revisions. During this time, he refused any other type of therapeutic intervention for his arteriovenous malformation (,Figs 1,,,â€“,3,). At physical examination, the neurologic examination findings were unremarkable, with the exception of mild gait unsteadiness that had decreased in severity after the gamma knife procedure.
