 A 21 year-old woman presented with decreased visual acuity in her right eye. At admission, visual acuity was 20/70 in her right eye and 20/20 in her left eye. For the previous 20 days, this patient had also experienced migrainelike headache, vertigo, tinnitus, and vomiting. She had no uveitis or keratoconjunctivitis. Her medical history did not include any other pertinent findings.

A week after admission, this patient developed weakness on the left side of her body, partial hearing loss in her left ear, and visual impairment in her left eye. Otoscopic findings were unremarkable. Audiologic evaluation revealed sensorineural low-frequency hearing loss in her left ear and normal hearing in her right ear. The results of laboratory studies, including autoimmune panels, were normal. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain was performed (,Figs 1,,â€“,4).
