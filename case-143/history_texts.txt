 A 49-year-old woman was referred to the internal medicine outpatient clinic for work-up of nonpitting edema. Her history was remarkable for a substantial weight gain (75 lbs [33.75 kg]) in the 6 months before presentation; this weight was distributed mainly in her thighs and upper arms.

Her medical history was remarkable for mild essential hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis, both of which were controlled effectively with medication. She denied increasing her caloric intake. Her alcohol intake was excessive, with consumption of more than 1.5 L of wine per day; however, there was nothing to suggest cirrhosis of the liver.

At physical examination, there was evidence of swelling in her upper limbs, with bilateral proximal arm circumference of 54 cm. According to the patient, her arm circumference was 39 cm 6 months earlier. Swelling was present but less impressive in the forearms. Swelling was also present across her upper chest, at the base of her neck, and in her upper thighs. There was no evidence of pitting edema. The findings of routine screening blood work, including complete blood count and electrolyte analysis, were normal. Thyroid-stimulating hormone levels and 24-hour urine cortisol concentrations were also normal. Subsequently, this patient underwent computed tomography (CT) of the head, neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis (,Figure,,,,,,).
