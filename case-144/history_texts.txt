 A 28-year-old right-handed man presented with long-standing occipital headache, progressive ataxia, and blurred vision. He had begun vomiting 8–10 days earlier. He had no other important history. Neurologic examination revealed average intelligence and was remarkable for cerebellar ataxia. Papilledema was noted at fundoscopy. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain was performed (,Figs 1,,,,–,4). No abnormality was noted on apparent diffusion coefficient maps or T2*-weighted gradient-echo images (not shown).
