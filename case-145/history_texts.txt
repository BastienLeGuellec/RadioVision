A 73-year-old man who had undergone right hemicolectomy for colon cancer 1 year previously had an abdominal mass that was found at follow-up computed tomography performed at an outside institution. We performed contrast agent–enhanced (15 mL gadodiamide, Omniscan; GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ) abdominal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to assess this mass (,Figs 1,,–,3).
